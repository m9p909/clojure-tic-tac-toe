# tic-tac-toe

generated using Luminus version "4.30"

I wrote this small two player tic tac toe game for fun. I figured it would be a good way to get familiar with clojure. There is lots of innovative and interesting things in the luminus framework/template. 

- the request and response type is defined in the headers
- the pipeline style of functional thinking is really good for backend servers because most of them have a couple simple steps. receive data -> format data -> validate data -> fetch response data from db -> format data -> return data. I think this model would allow a configuration based approach where each endpoint is essentially a map of data or functions.
- Frontend is in re-frame, which is kind of like react and redux combined together
- https://tic-tac-toe-clojure123.herokuapp.com/. Click create game, to make a new game and then you get a game code. Have someone else enter the game code, and you will be playing tic tac toe in real time with the other person!
